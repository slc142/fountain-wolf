# Known bugs

- FlowController delay is not handled properly, causing water flow split branches to not flow simultaneously for straight pieces, and some branches have water begin to flow before the water has finished falling into them.
- Drop indicator casts shadows, which is not intended.
- Goal piece visuals are not correct. Water does not spread through the entire piece.
- Water path animation code may cause game crash.
